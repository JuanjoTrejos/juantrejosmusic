ChatGPT said:
It looks like you're trying to share a local file (file:///Users/juanjosetrejos/Downloads/Unit-1%20Assignment.html). Unfortunately, I can't access files from your computer directly through a file:// link.

If you'd like me to help with that HTML file, you can:

Copy and paste the HTML code here
â€“ I'll review or modify it as needed.

Upload the file directly into this chat
â€“ Click the paperclip ðŸ“Ž icon and upload the .html file so I can open and work with it.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

ChatGPT said:
Your HTML file is mostly set up correctly, but a few fixes and additions are needed to complete the assignment tasks. Here's a corrected and updated version with:

An <h1> element inserted by JavaScript.

Your name and major displayed both on the page and in the console.

The Alert function corrected to lowercase alert().

âœ… Updated HTML with working JavaScript:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <title>WDV221 Intro Javascript</title>

  <style>
    div#container {
      width: 960px;
      margin: auto;
      padding: 10px;
      background-color: white;
      border: thin solid black;
    }
  </style>

  <script>
    // 1. Output an h1 element that says 'Assignment 1'
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
      const header = document.createElement("h1");
      header.textContent = "Assignment 1";
      document.getElementById("container").appendChild(header);

      // 2. Display name and major on the page and in the console
      const nameMajor = document.createElement("p");
      nameMajor.textContent = "Name: Juanjo Trejos, Major: Computer Information Systems";
      document.getElementById("container").appendChild(nameMajor);
      console.log("Name: Juanjo Trejos, Major: Computer Information Systems");

      // 3. Correct the alert function
      alert("You are on your way to working with Javascript");
    });
  </script>
</head>

<body>
  <div id="container">
    <h1>WDV221 Intro Javascript</h1>
    <h2>Introduction to Javascript - Assignment 1</h2>

    <p>Tasks:</p>
    <p>1. The instructions are in the code.</p>
    <p>2. Create a run time script that will display your name and major on the page AND on the console log.</p>
    <p>3. Fix the run time script on the bottom of this page.</p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
ðŸ§ª How to Test:
Save this code in a .html file.

Open it in a browser.

You should see a new <h1> that says "Assignment 1", your name and major, and a popup alert.

Check the browser console (F12) to confirm the message is logged there.

Let me know if you want the file version re-uploaded!
